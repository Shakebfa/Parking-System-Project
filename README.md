# Parking-System-Project
This project aims to connect BagelBone Green card with ARM based CPU to Linux VM and STM32 Board together.
The project is divided into three main parts:
1. TCP Server capable of handling multiple clients and processing parking data (on Linux VM)
2. Database (DB) for storing pricing information and customer data
3. System integrating STM32 microcontroller and BeagleBone Green (BBG) for emulating GPS coordinates and transmitting them to the server.
